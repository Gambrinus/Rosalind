These are my solutions for the Rosalind Project (rosalind.info). These are done purely for my own practice and education.

Most are not optimal solutions, and looking at this code without giving the problem your best shot first really defeats the purpose. But if you are sturggling with a problem and just need some help, feel free to check it out.
